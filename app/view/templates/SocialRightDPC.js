		'<em>"Engine Yard is thrilled to be a part of DPC this year. As one of the most prominent PHP conferences in Europe, we like the diverse topics and the great atmosphere that DPC provides. We are proud to be sponsoring the social event specifically, because we love when talented people from all over the globe are brought together in a relaxed, fun atmosphere. We\'ve found that\'s where community bonds strengthen, where interesting conversations happen, and where ideas are born, and we\'re happy to help make that happen at DPC.</em>"<br>' +

	'There is free beer &amp; wine! On a more serious note, conference sessions are a great way to pick up textbook technical knowledge, but as professionals we learn a lot from general discussions with one another. With so many interesting and talented people from the industry, as speakers but of course also as attendees, we want to take the opportunity to meet you all and allow everyone to mix and share ideas. We consider this event an integral part of the conference, and we hope you will join us!</p>' +
