	'Why?</h2>' +
'<p>' +
	'There is free beer &amp; wine! On a more serious note, conference sessions are a great way to pick up textbook technical knowledge, but as professionals we learn a lot from general discussions with one another. With so many interesting and talented people from the industry, as speakers but of course also as attendees, we want to take the opportunity to meet you all and allow everyone to mix and share ideas. We consider this event an integral part of the conference, and we hope you will join us!</p>' +
